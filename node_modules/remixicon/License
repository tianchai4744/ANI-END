Remix Icon License v1.0
Version 1.0 – January 2026
Copyright (c) 2017–2026 Remix Design

   This License governs the use of the Remix Icon library, including all icons,
   SVG files, font files, and related assets (collectively, the "Icons").

1. Grant of License

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Remix Design grants you
   a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify,
   merge, and distribute the Icons, as permitted below.

2. Permitted Uses

   You are permitted to:

   2.1 Commercial and Non-Commercial Use
       Use the Icons in personal, commercial, and client projects, including
       but not limited to:
       - Websites, web applications, and mobile applications
       - Software products and SaaS platforms
       - User interface designs, design systems, and UI kits
       - Presentations, documentation, and marketing materials
       - Physical or digital products where the Icons are decorative or
       functional elements

   2.2 Modification and Derivative Works
       - Modify, adapt, or customize the Icons
       - Change colors, sizes, stroke styles, or other visual attributes
       to fit your project needs

   2.3 Distribution as Part of a Larger Work
       Include the Icons (modified or unmodified) as part of a larger product,
       provided that:
       - The Icons are functional or decorative components of the product, and
       - The Icons are not marketed or sold as the primary value of the product

   2.4 Attribution (Optional)
       Attribution to Remix Icon is appreciated but not required.
       Suggested attribution:
       "Icons by Remix Icon (https://remixicon.com)"

3. Restrictions

   3.1 Prohibited: Standalone Icon Sales
       You may NOT:
       - Sell, sublicense, or distribute the Icons as a standalone product
       - Package the Icons as an independent icon pack, icon library, or
       icon font for sale
       - Offer the Icons as a downloadable asset collection where the Icons
       themselves constitute the primary product value

       Clarification:
       A product is considered a prohibited standalone icon sale if:
       - The Icons are the primary advertised feature, or
       - Removing the Icons would eliminate the core value of the product

       Examples:
       - Prohibited: "Premium Icon Pack – 2,000+ Icons for $29"
       - Prohibited: "Extended Remix Icon Library (Paid)"
       - Permitted: Website or app templates that include Icons as UI elements
       - Permitted: Design systems or UI kits where Icons are a minor component

   3.2 Prohibited: Competing Icon Libraries
       You may NOT use the Icons to create, distribute, or sell a competing
       icon library or icon set, even if the Icons are modified with only
       minor or superficial changes (such as color, size, stroke width,
       corner radius, or layout).

   3.3 Prohibited: Logo, Trademark, and Brand Identity Use
       You may NOT use the Icons, whether modified or unmodified, as:
       - A logo, trademark, or brand identifier
       - The primary visual identity of a company, product, or service

       This includes, but is not limited to:
       - Creating a logo by applying simple modifications such as color changes,
       rotation, combination, or layout
       - Using an Icon as a brand mark, app icon, or identity symbol where the
       Icon itself represents the brand

       Rationale:
       Remix Icon is designed for functional and informational use. Using the
       Icons as brand identifiers may impair their recognizability and neutrality
       in other functional contexts.

4. Brand Icons and Trademarks

   Some Icons represent third-party brands or services.

   4.1 Permitted Use of Brand Icons
       You may use brand icons solely to represent or link to the corresponding
       brand, product, or service.
       Examples:
       - Using a GitHub icon to link to a GitHub repository
       - Displaying social media icons in a website footer

   4.2 Prohibited Use of Brand Icons
       You may NOT:
       - Use brand icons as your own logo or trademark
       - Modify brand icons to create a new brand identity
       - Use brand icons in a way that implies endorsement or affiliation
       by the brand owner
       - Use brand icons for purposes unrelated to the represented brand

   4.3 Trademark Responsibility
       All brand icons are subject to the trademark rights of their respective
       owners. This License does not grant any trademark rights.
       Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of brand icons complies
       with applicable trademark laws.

5. Copyright and License Notice

   When distributing the complete Icon library or substantial portions thereof:

   - You must retain existing copyright notices in source files
   - You should include a copy of this License or a link to it

   For individual use of Icons within projects (e.g., compiled apps, websites,
   presentations), no copyright notice is required.

6. No Trademark Rights

   This License does not grant permission to use:

   - The "Remix Icon" name, logo, or trademarks
   - Any trademarks represented by brand icons

   You may refer to Remix Icon by name solely for attribution purposes.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty

   THE ICONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

8. Limitation of Liability

   IN NO EVENT SHALL REMIX DESIGN BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
   FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE ICONS OR THEIR USE.

9. License Compatibility

   You may integrate the Icons into projects under permissive licenses
   (such as MIT, BSD, or Apache 2.0), provided that:

   - The Icons themselves remain governed by this License
   - The restrictions in Section 3 continue to apply

   This License may be incompatible with licenses that require unrestricted
   redistribution of assets as standalone products or mandatory application
   of strong copyleft or share-alike terms.

10. Termination

   Your rights under this License terminate automatically if you breach its
   terms.

   Upon termination:

   - You must cease any distribution that violates this License
   - You may continue to use the Icons in projects already distributed
   prior to termination
   - End users who received such projects are not affected

11. License Versioning

   Remix Design may publish revised versions of this License.

   You may choose to use the Icons under:

   - The version of this License under which you received them, or
   - Any later version published by Remix Design

   Once chosen, that version may be used indefinitely.
